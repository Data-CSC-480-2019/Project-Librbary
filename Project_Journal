 My name is Theodore Ryan and member of team of students from Saint Martin's University that is working on senior project that is doing a product comparison for a report for our school library to build a repository.
  Some question are:

  What is the size of resources to maintain sand operate a Islandora system? Server space/ software/
 What is the overall cost? Monthly? or yearly?
 Security issues that need to be addressed?
 Does it need separate user inaction system?

  These just dome that I am looking at. IF there is way to do a phone meeting would be great for my team.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. You can contact me Tryan@stmartin.edu or 253-677-9665(cell). CC is our team leader Raj Bhetwal.

Thank you for your time
Respectfully
Theodore Ryan
